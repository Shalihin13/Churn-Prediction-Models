# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

✍️ This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction enables businesses to proactively retain customers by identifying those at risk of leaving.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build a model to predict whether a customer will churn (unsubscribe) or not.
- **Tasks Covered:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Training & Evaluation
  - Model Interpretation

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Telecom Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Features:** Demographics, account info, service usage
- **Target:** `Churn` (Yes / No)

---

## 🤖 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest

---

## 🧠 Evaluation Metrics

- Precision  
- Recall  
- Confusion Matrix

📌 **Key Finding:**  
- Features like `MonthlyCharges`, `ContractType`, and `Tenure` are highly correlated with churn.
- **Logistic Regression** performed best with a **Recall of 0.80**.
